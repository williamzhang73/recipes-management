# full-stack-project

A full stack TypeScript solo project.

## Getting Started

---

### Use this template to create a new repo on your GitHub account

1. Click the green `Use this template` button, select `Create a new repository`
   1. Under `Owner` select your username
   1. Give your repository a name. Name it after your application. The name `full-stack-project` is _not_ a good name.
   1. (Optional) Add a description
   1. Leave repository as `Public`
   1. **DO NOT** Include all branches
   1. Click the green `Create repository from template` button

---

### Clone Newly created repo into `lfz-code`

1. From your newly created repo on GitHub, click the green `<> Code` button, then copy **SSH** URL
1. Open `lfz-code`, click on blue `><` button in bottom left of `lfz-code`
   1. Select `Clone Repository in Container Volume...`
   1. Paste **SSH** URL for your repo, click `Clone git repository from URL`

### Run and test project setup

#### Getting Started

1. Install all dependencies with `npm install`.

#### Create the database

If your project will be using a database, create it now.

1. Start PostgreSQL
   ```sh
   sudo service postgresql start
   ```
1. Create database (replace `name-of-database` with a name of your choosing, such as the name of your app)
   ```sh
   createdb name-of-database
   ```
1. In the `server/.env` file, in the `DATABASE_URL` value, replace `changeMe` with the name of your database, from the last step
1. While you are editing `server/.env`, also change the value of `TOKEN_SECRET` to a custom value, without spaces.
1. Make the same changes to `server/.env.example`.

If your project will _not_ be using a database, edit `package.json` to remove the `dev:db` script.

#### Start the development servers

1. Start all the development servers with the `"dev"` script:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
1. Later, when you wish to stop the development servers, type `Ctrl-C` in the terminal where the servers are running.

#### Verify the client

1. A React app has already been created for you.

Go to the browser, and enter http://localhost:8080, a react app should be running. If not, make sure your database set up correctly, and your development servers are running.

#### Set up the database

1. Copy the pre generated sql below, and paste into the schema.sql in database folder.

   ```SQL
   set client_min_messages to warning;
   -- DANGER: this is NOT how to do it in the real world.
   -- `drop schema` INSTANTLY ERASES EVERYTHING.
   drop schema "public" cascade;

   create schema "public";

   CREATE TABLE "public"."likes" (
   "likesId" serial,
   "userId" integer not null,
   "recipeId" integer not null,
   "createdAt" timestamptz(6) not null default now(),
   primary key ("likesId")
   );

   CREATE TABLE "public"."likes" (
   "likesId" serial,
   "userId" integer not null,
   "recipeId" integer not null,
   "createdAt" timestamptz(6) not null default now(),
   primary key ("likesId")
   );

   CREATE TABLE "public"."likes" (
   "likesId" serial,
   "userId" integer not null,
   "recipeId" integer not null,
   "createdAt" timestamptz(6) not null default now(),
   primary key ("likesId")
   );

   CREATE TABLE "public"."likes" (
   "likesId" serial,
   "userId" integer not null,
   "recipeId" integer not null,
   "createdAt" timestamptz(6) not null default now(),
   primary key ("likesId")
   );

   CREATE TABLE "public"."users" (
   "userId" serial,
   "username" text not null,
   "hashedPwd" text not null,
   "userEmail" text not null,
   "OTP" text,
   "expiration" timestamptz(6),
   "createdAt" timestamptz(6) not null default NOW(),
   primary key ("userId")
   );

   CREATE TABLE "public"."recipes" (
   "recipeId" serial,
   "userId" integer not null,
   "title" text not null,
   "imageUrl" text not null,
   "preparationTime" integer not null,
   "cuisine" text not null,
   "glutenFree" boolean,
   "vegetarian" boolean,
   "ingredients" text not null,
   "instructions" text not null,
   "createdAt" timestamptz(6) not null default now(),
   primary key ("recipeId")
   );

   CREATE TABLE "public"."comments" (
   "commentId" serial,
   "userId" integer not null,
   "recipeId" integer not null,
   "message" text not null,
   "createdAt" timestamptz(6) not null default now(),
   primary key ("commentId")
   );

   ALTER TABLE "likes" ADD FOREIGN KEY ("userId") REFERENCES "users" ("userId");
   ALTER TABLE "likes" ADD FOREIGN KEY ("recipeId") REFERENCES "recipes" ("recipeId");
   ALTER TABLE "recipes" ADD FOREIGN KEY ("userId") REFERENCES "users" ("userId");
   ALTER TABLE "comments" ADD FOREIGN KEY ("userId") REFERENCES "users" ("userId");
   ALTER TABLE "comments" ADD FOREIGN KEY ("recipeId") REFERENCES "recipes" ("recipeId");
   ALTER TABLE "users" ADD CONSTRAINT unique_username UNIQUE ("username");
   ```

1. In a separate terminal, run `cd name-of-app` and then `npm run db:import` to create your tables
1. Use `psql` to verify your tables were created successfully (see [LFZ Database Guide](https://lms.learningfuze.com/code-guides/Learning-Fuze/curriculum/database) for tips).

1. After any changes to `database/schema.sql` or `database/data.sql` re-run the `npm run db:import` command to update your database. Use `psql` to verify your changes were successfully applied.

### Available `npm` commands explained

Below is an explanation of all included `npm` commands in the root `package.json`. Several are only used for deployment purposes and should not be necessary for development.

1. `start`
   - The `start` script starts the Node server in `production` mode, without any file watchers.
1. `build`
   - The `build` script executes `npm run build` in the context of the `client` folder. This builds your React app for production. This is used during deployment, and not commonly needed during development.
1. `db:import`
   - The `db:import` script executes `database/import.sh`, which executes the `database/schema.sql` and `database/data.sql` files to build and populate your database.
1. `dev`
   - Starts all the development servers.
1. `lint`
   - Runs ESLint against all the client and server code.
1. Not directly used by developer
   1. `install:*`
   - These scripts install dependencies in the `client` and `server` folders, and copy `.env.example` to `.env` if it doesn't already exist.
   1. `dev:*`
   - These scripts start the individual development servers.
   1. `lint:*`
   - These scripts run lint in the client and server directories.
   1. `postinstall`
      - The `postinstall` script is automatically run when you run `npm install`. It is executed after the dependencies are installed. Specifically for this project the `postinstall` script is used to install the `client` and `server` dependencies.
   1. `prepare`
      - The `prepare` script is similar to `postinstall` â€” it is executed before `install`. Specifically for this project it is used to install `husky`.
   1. `deploy`
      - The `deploy` script is used to deploy the project by pushing the `main` branch to the `pub` branch, which triggers the GitHub Action that deploys the project.
